    <h2>How to make Polpette</h2>
        <p>These tasty Italian meatballs <b>(Polpette)</b> start off in the oven, and finish by simmering in a simple tomato sauce. We love them as a main dish, with a side of <em>sautéed</em> zucchini and a salad.
        </p>
        <h3>Polpette ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground sweet Italian pork sausage</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>2/3 cup minced shallot</li>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<sup>*</sup></li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>2 (24-ounce) jars tomato puree</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
                <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p><sup><b>*</b></sup>No salt is added in the meatballs because the sweet Italian sausage, seasoned breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese add quite a bit of salt. Taste finished dish and season with salt if necessary.</p>
            <h3>How to Make Polpette Step-By-Step</h3>   
            <dl>
                    <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
                    <dd>Combine sausage, ground beef, shallot, Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to break up the ground meat and roughly mix ingredients together. Stir in beaten eggs, milk, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix all ingredients well.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
                    <dd>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
                    <dd>Pour water into a shallow bowl, and moisten fingertips and palms with water. Shape meatball mixture into about 40 ping-pong sized balls and place on the prepared sheet pan. When fingers become sticky, dip them in water.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
                    <dd>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a bit underdone in the center, about 20 minutes. If meatballs are larger, adjust baking time.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Step 5</b></dt>
                    <dd>Pour tomato purée into a large sauce pot or a Dutch oven set over medium-low heat. Stir in minced garlic and Italian herbs. Sample the sauce for seasoning, and adjust, if needed.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Step 6</b></dt>
                    <dd>When sauce begins to bubble slightly, add meatballs and stir gently, coating all the meatballs with sauce. Keep meatballs and sauce at a low simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Step 7</b></dt>
                    <dd>To serve, place meatballs and sauce on a plate, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</dd>
